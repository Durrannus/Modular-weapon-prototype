# Modular Weapon Prototype

A small Godot prototype that answers one question: **is building a sword from parts, and swapping them, fun?**

This is **milestone 1, "Sword v2 feels good"**: one arena, single player, a sword built from four parts plus charms, three elements, three enemy types and a training dummy that shows damage per second. It's done when you can build three swords that play clearly differently, and the wooden sword feels plain next to them.

## How to run it

1. Install [Godot 4.7](https://godotengine.org/download) (the standard build, not .NET).
2. Open Godot, click **Import**, and pick the `project.godot` file in this folder.
3. Press **F5** (or the Play button at the top right).

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard and mouse | Controller |
|---|---|---|
| Move | WASD or arrows | Left stick or d-pad |
| Aim | Mouse | Right stick (or move direction) |
| Attack (steps through the combo) | Left click | X or right trigger |
| Dodge | Space, Shift or right click | A or left trigger |
| Open / close the forge | Tab | Y |
| Pause enemy spawning | P | Start |

**At the forge** (the game pauses):

- Mouse: click a part in the list to pick it up, click the grid to place it, click a placed part to pick it back up.
- Keys or controller: arrows or d-pad move the cursor, Q/E or LB/RB choose a part, Enter or A place or pick up, Esc or B put a part back.

Swapping is free.

## The sword

The grid is drawn in the shape of a sword, tip at the top:

```
b b b    blade area: one big blade, or several small blades side by side
b b b
b b b
h h h    hilt (one)
c g c    g = handle (one, 2 tall), c = charm squares (2)
  g
  p      pommel (one)
```

Each part only fits its own spot, without rotating. You can have one pommel, one handle and one hilt. Blades are the exception: several small blades can share the blade area. The shape is set by `SHAPE_MAP` in `scripts/weapon/weapon_build.gd`.

### The combo

Pommel, handle and hilt each give **one move**, set by the part's shape. Attacking plays them in order from the bottom of the sword up, then loops:

**pommel move → handle move → hilt move (finisher, short pause after it) → pommel move ...**

Stop attacking for half a second, or dodge, and it resets to the pommel move.

| Move | How it feels |
|---|---|
| slash | Quick, wide arc in front |
| stab | Quick, long and narrow |
| lunge | Dash forward, then a strong stab |
| spin | Slower, hits all around you |
| overhead | Slow wind-up, narrow, very hard hit with big knockback |

The moves are tuned in `MOVES` in `scripts/player.gd` (wind-up, total time, reach, arc, power, knockback).

### Blades and elements

- Blade damage adds up. A big blade (Iron Longblade) hits harder and reaches further but swings slower.
- Small blades (shards) do less damage each but add an element.

| Element | On hit |
|---|---|
| Fire | Burns for a few seconds |
| Water | Slows the enemy |
| Lightning | Jumps to one nearby enemy |
| **Steam** (fire + water) | Bursts and scalds enemies next to the target |
| **Electrified** (water + lightning) | Jumps to three enemies and stuns them |

Damage numbers are coloured by element and bigger for crits (with a "!"). The dummy shows damage per second for the last few seconds.

### Stats and materials

| Part | Leans towards |
|---|---|
| Blade | Damage, reach |
| Hilt | Crit chance, area |
| Handle | Attack speed |
| Pommel | Move speed, crit damage |
| Charm | One small bonus (Swift: attack speed, Keen: crit chance) |

A part's **material** multiplies its numbers: wood x1.0, iron x1.4 (`MATERIALS` in `weapon_build.gd`). So an iron part with the same shape does the same move, just better.

### Starter parts

| Part | Parts and their move |
|---|---|
| Pommel | Wooden (slash), Curved (slash, more crit damage), Spike (stab, faster movement) |
| Handle | Wooden (slash), Wrapped (stab, faster attacks), Long (lunge) |
| Hilt | Wooden (slash), Cross (overhead), Spin (spin; the future mini boss reward, unlocked for testing) |
| Blade | Wooden Blade, Iron Longblade, Fire Shard, Water Shard, Lightning Shard |
| Charm | Swift Charm, Keen Charm |

You start with the wooden sword: wooden pommel, handle, hilt and blade, so slash, slash, slash.

Some builds to try: Spin Hilt + Wrapped Handle + fire and water shards (steam); Iron Longblade + Cross Hilt + Long Handle + Curved Pommel (big slow hits); three shards (every element, both combos).

## Adding a part

Parts are data files in `parts/`. Every `.tres` file in that folder is loaded automatically.

1. In Godot's FileSystem panel, right click a part (for example `parts/cross_hilt.tres`) and choose **Duplicate**.
2. Click the new file and change its values in the Inspector: name, type, material, shape, colour, move, and stats.
3. Give it a new `id`. Run the game and it's in the parts list.

Then check it still fits its spot on the sword:

```
godot --headless --script res://tests/check_parts.gd
```

## Project layout

```
project.godot            Godot project settings
scenes/main.tscn         The only scene; everything else is built in code
scripts/main.gd          Arena, spawning, the starting sword
scripts/player.gd        Movement, dodge, the five moves, elements
scripts/enemy.gd         Slime, charger, brute and training dummy (with DPS)
scripts/weapon/weapon_build.gd   The grid, its rules, materials and element combos
scripts/parts/part_data.gd       What a part file contains
scripts/parts/part_library.gd    Loads every part in parts/
scripts/ui/build_menu.gd         The forge screen
scripts/ui/hud.gd                Health, dodge, kills, combo display
scripts/fx/                      Swing effects and damage numbers
scripts/input_setup.gd           All key and controller bindings
parts/*.tres             The 16 starter parts and charms
tests/check_parts.gd     Checks every part fits its spot
```

The weapon's stats come out of `WeaponBuild.compute()` as one plain dictionary, so online play can send it across later without a rewrite.

## Art

Everything is drawn with simple shapes for now. Real sprites and the switch to 640x360 come in milestone 2. Textures already use nearest filtering and 2D snaps to whole pixels.

When you're knocked out you respawn at the start point.

## Not in this prototype yet

Online co-op, the mini boss and part drop, rarity and affixes, a second weapon type.
